# MFWSOGH
First website that I am working on using GitHub (when finished on my server, will post on GitHub).
This website will have different categories (like computer, mental health, cats, etc), directories and user submitted items where an admin or moderator can incorporate into the sections user request them in. If you wish to submit an idea feel free to submit a pull request.
